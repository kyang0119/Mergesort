# Mergesort

1.Convert "merge" (the previous project) into a subroutine. Write a "main" program to perform mergesorting of a list of integers by calling "merge" repeatedly. For example, if the sorting program takes (6, 5, 9, 1, 7, 0, -3, 2) as input, it will produce a sorted list (-3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).


2. The original unsorted list of integers should be received from the keyboard input. Your program should first ask for user to input the number of integers in the original list, and then ask for inputting all the integers. The total number of integers to be sorted by this program should be a power of 2. This means, the program should work with a list of 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 (...) integers (but your program needs only to handle up to 32 integers).
The final sorted list (in increasing order) should be stored in the data area, that starts with the label "list:". The sorted list should also be displayed on the screen (console).
